# Cat vs Dog Classifier - Deep Learning Project

#### Overview
This project is designed to classify images of cats and dogs using deep learning techniques. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow and Keras. This is my first step into the deep learning field, where I have learned and applied various key concepts such as data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Key Learnings

### 1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning:**
   - **Data Cleaning:** I performed necessary data cleaning on the raw dataset, including handling missing data and ensuring the quality of the dataset.
   - **Data Preprocessing & Normalization:** I preprocessed the images (resizing, normalization) to ensure they are in a format suitable for model training.
   - **Managing Image Data:** I organized the image data by categorizing them into separate folders (cats and dogs).

### 2. **Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models:**
   - **Model Selection & Training:**
     - I utilized **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification, a key technique in deep learning for handling visual data.
     - **Model Training:** I defined and trained the model from scratch, including adding layers and optimizing the model's performance.
   - **Transfer Learning & Fine-tuning:** I learned how to fine-tune pre-trained models for better results, enhancing my understanding of transfer learning.
   - **Activation Functions:** I explored how activation functions like **ReLU** affect the model's ability to learn.

### 3. **Data Augmentation & Model Performance:**
   - **Data Augmentation:** I used techniques like image rotation, shifting, and flipping to augment the dataset and increase the diversity of the training data.
   - **Combating Overfitting:** To prevent overfitting, I implemented techniques such as **Dropout** and early stopping.

### 4. **Model Evaluation & Improvement:**
   - **Accuracy & Loss Metrics:** I tracked the model's accuracy and loss during training and used this information to identify areas for improvement.
   - **Improving Model for Future Use:** I learned how to assess the performance of a model and define goals for future improvement.

### 5. **Saving & Loading the Model:**
   - **Saving the Model:** I saved the trained model using `tf.keras.models.save_model()` to enable future use without needing to retrain.
   - **Loading the Model:** I learned how to load the saved model and apply it to new data, making the model reusable.

### 6. **Managing Dataset and File Organization:**
   - **File Management:** I efficiently managed the dataset by organizing images into separate folders for cats and dogs.
   - **Dataset Path Management:** I became proficient in managing dataset paths and ensuring the correct loading of images.

### 7. **Performance Optimization & Error Handling:**
   - **Output Handling:** I optimized the output display and reduced unnecessary logs, making the training process more efficient.
   - **Error Management:** I learned how to debug and handle errors that arise during training and prediction processes.

### 8. **Results Visualization:**
   - **Saving Predictions:** After testing the model on new images, I saved the predictions in a CSV file, making it easy to review the results and submit predictions.

### 9. **Bug Fixing & Troubleshooting:**
   - I identified and fixed several issues related to model training and predictions, improving the overall workflow.

### 10. **Project Growth & Career Development:**
   - **Portfolio Building:** This project serves as a foundational piece for my portfolio, showcasing my skills in deep learning, model development, and image classification.
   - **First Steps in Deep Learning:** This project marked my initial foray into deep learning, where I gained hands-on experience with neural networks, model building, and optimization.
